# AngularJS resume app
This is a small application that houses my resume which is backended in a json file. The end game intent is to have an easily navicable site where I can both view and print off my resume. It is also an excuse to get used to angularJS, bootstrap, and less as I become more involved in front end web work.

npm start should get you up and running.
